# Simple_OnlineStore

## Introduction

Welcome to the Simple_OnlineStore App! This is a simple online store application developed using Django, a high-level Python web framework. This README will guide you through the setup and usage of the app.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.6 or higher)
- Django (3.0 or higher)
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository (or download and extract the ZIP file):

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/django-online-store.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```
   cd django-online-store
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the project dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Apply the database migrations:

   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

7. Create a superuser (admin) account:

   ```
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

8. Start the development server:

   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Usage

1. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/admin/` to access the Django admin panel.

2. Log in using the superuser account created earlier.

3. You can manage items, categories, and orders through the admin panel.

4. To access the online store itself, go to `http://localhost:8000/store/`.

5. Users can browse products, add them to their cart, and place orders on the store's front-end.
